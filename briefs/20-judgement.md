## Character: The Terminator

### Quotes
- **Upright:** "Hasta la vista, baby wipe"

### Tarot Meaning
Judgement represents reflection, reckoning, awakening, and rebirth. Reversed: self-doubt, refusal of self-examination, ignoring the call.

### Composition

**Scene:** A post-apocalyptic battlefield at the moment of reckoning. The Terminator emerging from flames, judgment upon humanity. Machines and humans facing their moment of truth.

**Central Figure:** Terminator-butt striding through fire and debris, half-flesh half-metal endoskeleton revealed. Unstoppable, inevitable, judging.
