## Character: Forrest Gump

### Quotes

The Fool represents new beginnings, innocence, spontaneity, and a free spirit. Reversed: recklessness, fear of the unknown, risk-taking.

### Composition

**Scene:** A sun-drenched road stretching into the distance. Alabama countryside. A bus stop bench sits to one side.

**Forrest-Butt Design:**
- Medium, wholesome, slightly flat American butt
- Wearing a plaid shirt (open, draped over upper curve)
- White sneakers (the running shoes)
- Box of chocolates tucked under one arm

**Foreground:** A small dog or squirrel looking up at him (the Fool's companion).
