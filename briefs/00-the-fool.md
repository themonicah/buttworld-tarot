# 0 - The Fool

## Character: Forrest Gump

### Quotes
- **Upright:** "Life is like a box of flatulents"
- **Reversed:** "I gotta find Bubba's butt"

### Tarot Meaning
The Fool represents new beginnings, innocence, spontaneity, and a free spirit. Reversed: recklessness, fear of the unknown, risk-taking.

### Composition

**Scene:** A sun-drenched road stretching into the distance. Alabama countryside. A bus stop bench sits to one side.

**Central Figure:** Forrest-butt mid-stride, about to step off a curb/cliff edge (classic Fool motif). One leg lifted, arms slightly out for balance. Completely unaware of any danger.

**Forrest-Butt Design:**
- Medium, wholesome, slightly flat American butt
- Wearing a plaid shirt (open, draped over upper curve)
- White sneakers (the running shoes)
- Box of chocolates tucked under one arm
- Feather floating nearby

**Background:** Open road, blue sky with wispy clouds, maybe a shrimp boat in the far distance.

**Foreground:** A small dog or squirrel looking up at him (the Fool's companion).

### Color Palette
- Warm golden sunlight
- Blue sky, green grass
- Earth tones on Forrest
- Bright white sneakers as focal point

### Mood
Optimistic, naive, beautiful in its simplicity. He doesn't know where he's going, but he's going.

### Border Elements
Art Nouveau frame with:
- Feathers
- Running path motif
- Chocolates
- Shrimp

### Gags & Easter Eggs
- **Bench inscription:** "Life is like a box of flatulents" carved into the bus stop bench
- **Bubba-Gump Shrimp:** A tiny shrimp boat named "Jenny's Bottom" in the far background
- **The chocolates:** Box labeled "Ass-orted Chocolates"
- **Lieutenant Dan:** A legless butt sitting in the background giving a thumbs up
- **Ping pong paddle:** Tucked into his waistband (he was a champion)
- **Running route map:** On the bench, showing his cross-country run path shaped like a butt
- **Jenny's letter:** Sticking out of his pocket
- **Dr Pepper:** A bottle on the bench (he drank 15 Dr Peppers at the White House)
- **Medal of Honor:** Pinned to his shirt, but it's butt-shaped
