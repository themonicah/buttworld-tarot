# XIII - Death

## Character: Grim Reaper (Classic)

### Quotes
- **Upright:** *silent, holding hourglass of sand*
- **Reversed:** *silent, hourglass flipped*

### Tarot Meaning
Death represents endings, transitions, transformation, and change. Reversed: resistance to change, fear of endings, stagnation.

### Composition

**Scene:** A misty graveyard at the boundary between night and dawn. One side dark, one side light. A path through gravestones leading to an unknown horizon.

**Central Figure:** Grim Reaper-butt standing solemnly, scythe in one hand, hourglass in the other. Not threatening - patient, inevitable, almost kind.

**Grim Reaper-Butt Design:**
- Skeletal/pale butt (bones suggested through form)
- Long black hooded robe flowing down
- Bony hands holding scythe and hourglass
- Face hidden in hood shadow (or skull face on butt)
- Peaceful, patient stance
- Slightly translucent/ethereal quality

**Scythe:**
- Classic curved blade
- Weathered wooden handle
- Catches the first light of dawn

**Hourglass:**
- Sand falling (upright) or just flipped (reversed)
- Ornate, ancient-looking
- Glowing slightly

**Background:**
- Graveyard with varied tombstones
- Dead tree on one side, blooming tree on other (cycle)
- Rising sun on horizon
- Mist swirling at ground level
- White rose growing from grave

**Symbolic Elements:**
- The white rose (death's purity)
- Flag with five petals (Rider-Waite reference)
- River (the Styx or transition)
- Fallen king/figures (optional - subtle)

### Color Palette
- Deep blacks and greys
- Dawn pinks and golds on horizon
- Pale bone whites
- Single white rose as accent

### Mood
Solemn but not scary. Transformation, not termination. Respectful silence.

### Border Elements
Art Nouveau frame with:
- Skulls (subtle)
- Hourglasses
- Roses (white)
- Scythes
- Transitional motifs (cocoon to butterfly)
