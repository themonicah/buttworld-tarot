# XVIII - The Moon

## Character: Sailor Moon

### Quotes
- **Upright:** "In the name of the moon, I will poonish you"
- **Reversed:** "Moon prism power, make-up wind"

### Tarot Meaning
The Moon represents illusion, fear, anxiety, and the subconscious. Reversed: release of fear, repressed emotions, inner confusion.

### Composition

**Scene:** A mystical moonlit scene combining Tokyo cityscape with the Moon Kingdom. Water reflecting the full moon, path leading into uncertain shadows.

**Central Figure:** Sailor Moon-butt in iconic pose - maybe the transformation pose or the pointing "I will punish you" pose. Moon dominating the sky behind her.
