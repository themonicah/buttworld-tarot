# VIII - Strength

## Character: He-Man

### Quotes
- **Upright:** "By the power of Greyskull, I have the bowel!"
- **Reversed:** "I said hey, what's going on in there"

### Tarot Meaning
Strength represents courage, inner strength, compassion, and influence. Reversed: self-doubt, weakness, insecurity.

### Composition

**Scene:** Castle Greyskull in the background, lightning striking its towers. He-Man in the classic pose of holding his sword aloft, transforming from Prince Adam.

**Central Figure:** He-Man-butt in the iconic power pose - sword raised high, lightning flowing into it, muscles (cheek muscles?) tensed. Maximum power fantasy.

**He-Man-Butt Design:**
- Absolutely jacked, heroic butt
- Blonde bowl cut on top (signature look)
- Leather harness crossed over torso area
- Fur loincloth/briefs
- Power Sword held high
- One foot on a rock

**Battle Cat Option:**
- Green tiger (Battle Cat) beside or beneath him
- Or a butt-tiger version
- Loyal, fierce, ready

**Background:**
- Castle Greyskull (skull-faced fortress)
- Lightning bolts striking from dramatic sky
- Eternia landscape (alien mountains, strange trees)
- Maybe Skeletor's silhouette in the distance

**Symbolic Elements:**
- Infinity symbol replaced with Greyskull
- Lion replaced with Battle Cat
- The sword as the true power source
- Transformation energy swirling

### Color Palette
- Heroic primary colors (He-Man's palette)
- Electric blues and purples (lightning)
- Orange/tan (skin tones)
- Green (Battle Cat)

### Mood
Powerful, heroic, campy but sincere. Pure 80s power fantasy unironically celebrated.

### Border Elements
Art Nouveau frame with:
- Lightning bolts
- Swords
- Castle Greyskull motifs
- Battle Cat stripes
- Muscles

### Gags & Easter Eggs
- **Cringer hiding:** A scared green cat butt peeking from behind a rock (pre-transformation)
- **Skeletor:** His skull face visible in storm clouds, shaking fist
- **"I HAVE THE POWER":** Lightning bolts spelling it out
- **Prince Adam's clothes:** Pink vest and purple tights discarded on ground nearby
- **Orko:** Tiny floating wizard butt in background looking amazed
- **Man-At-Arms:** Armored butt giving approving nod from distance
- **Teela:** Warrior woman butt looking impressed
- **Snake Mountain:** Visible in far distance (enemy headquarters)
- **The Sorceress:** Falcon flying overhead (her transformed state)
