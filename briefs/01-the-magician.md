# I - The Magician

## Character: Harry Potter

### Quotes
- **Upright:** "Expecto Pootronum"
- **Reversed:** "I solemnly swear I'm up to no good gas"

### Tarot Meaning
The Magician represents willpower, manifestation, resourcefulness, and power. Reversed: manipulation, untapped talents, trickery.

### Composition

**Scene:** Hogwarts Great Hall or a magical study. Floating candles above, stone walls. A table before him with the four suit symbols (wand, cup, sword, pentacle).

**Central Figure:** Harry-butt standing behind the table in classic Magician pose - one arm raised holding a wand pointed skyward, one pointing down. The "as above, so below" gesture.

**Harry-Butt Design:**
- Young, slightly scrawny butt
- Round glasses perched on upper curve (where eyes would be)
- Lightning bolt scar visible on one cheek
- Hogwarts robe draped over shoulders, Gryffindor scarf
- Wand in raised hand (holly, phoenix feather core)

**Background:** Floating candles, enchanted ceiling showing night sky, maybe a ghostly Patronus stag forming from gas/mist.

**Table Elements:**
- Wand (obvious)
- Goblet of Fire
- Sword of Gryffindor
- Golden Snitch (pentacle substitute)

### Color Palette
- Deep magical purples and blues
- Warm candlelight glow
- Gold accents (snitch, frames)
- Gryffindor red and gold

### Mood
Powerful, mystical, coming-of-age. The moment before casting a great spell.

### Border Elements
Art Nouveau frame with:
- Winding vines/magic swirls
- Small owls
- Stars and moons
- Hogwarts house crests in corners
