## Style Guide

### Visual Direction
- **Style:** Vintage movie poster (Drew Struzan-esque) with Art Nouveau borders
- **Tone:** Painterly, warm, atmospheric - the joke is in the contrast between serious art and butt puns
- **Aspect Ratio:** 1:1.73 (standard tarot)
- **Dimensions:** 1650 x 2850px at 300dpi (print-ready)

### Butt Character Design Principles
- Butts ARE the people - no existential commentary needed
- Expression through posture, not faces (unless you add small eyes)
- Accessories and props establish character (hats, items, clothing fragments)
- Each butt should have distinct shape/personality (round, flat, hairy, smooth, etc.)

### Color Palette
- Warm, painterly tones
- Strong chiaroscuro lighting
- Each card can have its own mood but should feel cohesive as a deck
